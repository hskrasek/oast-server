# oast.sh M0 — Prove the Council (Design)

> Scope: **M0 only** — the weekend experiment that answers one question:
> *Is a multi-model panel review sharper than asking one model once?*
> This doc plugs the M0-blocking gaps in `docs/oast-build-spec.md` and
> `docs/judge-rubric.md`. It does not redesign the platform; it makes M0 buildable.

## Goal & success criterion

Prove the Council (multi-model design panel) produces a sharper API-design review than
a single model, on **Dimension 1 — Domain & Resource Modeling**.

M0 produces **two** artifacts for every test spec, through the identical judge/format
path:

1. A **Council** review (3 panelists → judge).
2. A single-model **baseline** review (1 model → judge).

Both are persisted side-by-side so the go/no-go decision rests on directly comparable
output. If the Council isn't visibly sharper than the baseline, M0 has done its job —
stop cheaply.

## Non-goals (explicitly out of scope for M0)

SSE streaming, the Rust CLI, the web client, auth/billing, dimensions 2 & 7, the
Spectral pre-pass, `$ref` bundling / multi-file specs, cost caps, and the cloud
overlay. The word **"digest"** from the build spec's diagram is deferred — M0 sends the
raw spec; "digest" is reserved for a future large-spec token optimization and should be
renamed there to avoid implying summarization (which would break `location` pointers).

## Architecture

One engine, two thin entry points. The engine is a pure-ish function
`(spec, request) → result` that performs **no database writes**; the outer layers own
persistence. This honors Principle 2 of the build spec (stateless engine, state lives
outside) while giving M0 both an experiment driver and the REST-core deliverable.

        ▼

```

### Components

**`CouncilOrchestrator`** — the engine. No DB access. Calls panel/judge through the
**Laravel AI SDK** agents (it does not talk HTTP itself).

- **Council mode:** prompts **3 panelist model slugs** (from `config/oast.php`, hardcoded
  for M0; default one Anthropic + one OpenAI + one Google slug for cross-lab diversity)
  via the `PanelistAgent` with per-prompt `model:` overrides. Calls run **sequentially**
  in M0 (concurrency is an M1 SSE-era concern). A failed panelist is **retried once**.
  After retries, enforce a **quorum floor of ≥2 successful panelists** — fewer than 2
  fails the review with an error naming the dead models. A 1-model "panel" is not a panel.
- **Baseline mode:** a single model, one call, routed through the same judge/format path
  so its output shape matches the Council's.
- **Judge pass:** the `JudgeAgent` (`implements HasStructuredOutput`) runs one **dedicated
  strong model**, never a panelist. Receives the spec + all panel critiques + the
  Dimension 1 rubric (the rubric lives in the agent's `instructions()`). The SDK's
  **structured output (`schema()`)** forces the `{findings: [...]}` shape — enums and
  required fields — at the provider layer. The `FindingValidator` therefore enforces
  **only** the one rule JSON Schema can't express (`disagreement` required when
  `confidence = split`), with **one re-prompt retry** if it's violated. Second failure → error.
- **Returns** a `ReviewResult`: `findings[]`, per-model `{ms}`, `panelSize`,
  `mode` (council | baseline), `status`. (Per-model token/cost is a fast follow-up once
  the SDK's per-response usage accessor is confirmed — see Persistence.)

**Models reach OpenRouter via the Laravel AI SDK's built-in `openrouter` provider**
(`Lab::OpenRouter`, configured in `config/ai.php`). **BYOK** stays single-key via
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. Native multi-provider (Anthropic/OpenAI/Gemini with separate keys)
is an M1 option. The M0 endpoint is single-user with no auth layer.

**Finding validator** — the per-finding contract below is enforced by the `JudgeAgent`'s
`HasStructuredOutput` schema (enums, required fields) at the provider layer. The
`FindingValidator` only enforces the one conditional rule JSON Schema can't express —
`disagreement` required when `confidence = split` — and otherwise passes findings through
(an empty list is valid: a clean spec). The full contract, for reference:

```jsonc
{
  "dimension": "domain-modeling",
  "title": "string",
  "severity": "blocker | should-fix | consider",
  "confidence": "consensus | majority | split | lone-flag",
  "location": "#/json/pointer",
  "finding": "string",
  "why_it_matters": "string",
  "disagreement": "string (required only when confidence = split)",
  "suggested_change": "string"
}
```

**API endpoint** `POST /reviews`, served on the **`api.*` subdomain**
(`config('oast.api_domain')`, e.g. `api.oast.test` locally), not an `/api/` path prefix.
Endpoints are **unversioned by path** — the API evolves backwards-compatibly rather than
cutting `/v1`, `/v2` URL versions.
Implemented with the **ADR pattern**: an invokable single-action controller
(`app/Actions/Reviews/CreateReviewAction`) is the Action; an API Resource
(`ReviewResource`) is the Responder. Accepts a spec + mode, calls the orchestrator,
persists, returns JSON on success and **Problem Details (RFC 9457,
`application/problem+json`)** on error (see Error handling). Plain JSON, **no SSE** (SSE
arrives in M1). This is the M0 deliverable that establishes the REST-core shape.

**Artisan command** `oast:review {spec} {--baseline}` — the experiment driver. Runs the
orchestrator **live**, persists the result, prints findings + per-model latency to the
terminal. `--baseline` switches to single-model mode. This is what you run for the
weekend experiment.

## Prompts (the actual IP)

- **Panel prompt:** ask each panelist to critique an API specification's domain and
  resource modeling **freely, in its own words**. The panel is **NOT given the rubric** —
  this keeps disagreement genuine (per `judge-rubric.md`). The rubric lives only in the
  judge.
- **Judge prompt:** given the spec + all panel critiques + the Dimension 1 rubric,
  **organize** the critiques (do not merge or re-critique) into findings, assigning each a
  **severity** (blocker / should-fix / consider) and a **confidence** derived from
  cross-panel agreement (consensus / majority / split / lone-flag), and emit the
  structured JSON array. A *split / blocker* is the most valuable output and must surface
  both positions in `disagreement`.

## Persistence

A single `reviews` table (SQLite — already wired; in-memory for tests, file for dev).
The engine returns a `ReviewResult`; the outer layer (controller or command) writes it.

| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| `id` | PK |
| `spec_ref` | path/name of the input spec |
| `spec_hash` | hash of spec content (dedupe / compare runs) |
| `mode` | `council` \| `baseline` |
| `dimension` | `domain-modeling` for M0 |
| `panel_models` | JSON — model IDs actually used |
| `panel_size` | count of successful panelists |
| `raw_panel_responses` | JSON — each panelist's verbatim critique |
| `findings` | JSON — validated judge output |
| `metrics` | JSON — per-model `{ms}` (token/cost added once the SDK usage accessor is confirmed) |
| `status` | `complete` \| `error` |
| `created_at` / `updated_at` | timestamps |

This seeds the M1+ persistence layer rather than being throwaway.

> **Metrics scope (SDK consequence):** M0 records measured **latency** per call. The
> Laravel AI SDK doesn't document a per-response token/cost accessor for non-streaming
> prompts; capturing per-model cost (via `$response->usage` or the SDK's invocation
> logging) is a fast follow-up once confirmed against the installed version.

## Config

- `config/ai.php` (Laravel AI SDK): the built-in `openrouter` provider — `driver`,
  `key` (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`), `url` (`OPENROUTER_URL`).
- `config/oast.php`:
  - `panelists` — array of 3 hardcoded model slugs (config-driven roster in M1).
  - `judge` — judge model slug.
  - `baseline` — baseline model slug (null → first panelist).
  - `quorum` — minimum successful panelists (default 2).
  - `timeout` — per-call timeout.
  - `api_domain` — the `api.*` subdomain the REST API is served on.

## Error handling

API errors are returned as **Problem Details (RFC 9457)** — `application/problem+json`
built on the `crell/api-problem` library. The shape of the design:

- **`App\Http\Problems\ProblemDetailsResponse implements Responsable`** — a small wrapper
  around a Crell `ApiProblem` + status; `toResponse()` emits `application/problem+json`.
  Because it's `Responsable`, an action can `return` it and Laravel renders it.
- **`App\Http\Problems\ProvidesProblemDetails extends \Throwable`** — the contract every
  domain exception implements: `toProblemDetails(): ProblemDetailsResponse`. The action
  catches *this interface*, so adding a new error type needs no action change.
- **Named domain exceptions with factory methods** — `QuorumNotMetException::forModels(...)`,
  `InvalidJudgeOutputException::withErrors(...)` (private constructors). Each carries its
  data and knows how to render itself via `toProblemDetails()`.
- **`App\Http\Problems\ProblemType`** — stable `type` URI constants.
- Request validation reuses the wrapper via `ProblemDetailsResponse::fromValidation()` in
  the exception handler (scoped to the api host).

This dogfoods Dimension 6 (Error modeling) of the rubric. Status codes distinguish client
faults (4xx) from upstream-model faults (5xx):

| Failure | Behavior | HTTP |
|---|---|---|
| Panelist call fails | Retry once; if still failing, count as lost. | — (internal) |
| Request validation (e.g. missing `spec`) | `ValidationException` rendered as problem+json (`errors` extension) for the api host. | `422` |
| < 2 panelists succeed | `QuorumNotMetException` → problem+json (`failed_models` extension); persist `status = error`. | `503` |
| Judge output fails validation | One re-prompt with the validation error appended. | — (internal) |
| Judge still invalid | `InvalidJudgeOutputException` → problem+json; persist `status = error`. | `502` |

## Testing

Pest 4, functional style, using the **Laravel AI SDK's native fakes**
(`PanelistAgent::fake()`, `JudgeAgent::fake()`) — no live HTTP in the default suite. Three
layers:

1. **Orchestration tests** — SDK fakes (deterministic, free, CI-safe). Cover: happy-path
   Council; one panelist fails → retry → proceeds; quorum not met → review errors; judge
   invalid then retry succeeds; judge invalid twice → review errors.
2. **Schema contract tests** — the finding validator accepts well-formed findings and
   rejects: empty payload, an invalid `severity`/`confidence` enum, a missing `location`,
   and a `split` finding missing `disagreement`.
3. **Live smoke tests** — behind a Pest `->group('live')`, **excluded from the default
   `composer test` run** (`--exclude-group=live`), executed on demand to sanity-check the
   real model integration.

## Open item (requires user input, not a design decision)

**M0 test fixture** — build-spec Decision #4: *which real OpenAPI spec do you know well
enough to grade the review's quality against?* The experiment is only as trustworthy as
the spec you can judge the output against. Required before the first live run; pick one
spec you know cold (ideally one with at least one known domain-modeling smell, so there's
a right answer to compare against).

## Decisions locked in this session

| Gap | Decision |
|---|---|
| Panel composition | 3 models hardcoded for M0 (diverse frontier default), config-driven in M1. |
| Judge model | Dedicated strong model, never a panelist. |
| Judge validation | SDK structured output (`HasStructuredOutput`) enforces shape; `FindingValidator` owns only the `split`→`disagreement` rule; one re-prompt retry. |
| Panel partial failure | Retry each failed model once, then ≥2 quorum floor. |
| Spec input | Raw spec as-is; "digest" deferred. |
| M0 persistence | Persist run artifacts to a `reviews` table. |
| Testing | SDK native fakes + schema contract tests in CI; live tests isolated by Pest group. |
| Baseline comparison | `--baseline` mode in the same command/engine. |
| M0 dimension | Dimension 1 — Domain & Resource Modeling. |
| Runtime | PHP 8.5. |
| Model access | Laravel AI SDK (`laravel/ai`); OpenRouter via the built-in `openrouter` provider (`Lab::OpenRouter`), single-key BYOK. Native multi-provider deferred to M1. |
| Concurrency | Panel calls sequential in M0; concurrent fan-out is an M1 SSE-era concern. |
| API surface | Served on the `api.*` subdomain (not `/api/` path). |
| Entry-point pattern | ADR — invokable single-action controllers in `app/Actions`, API Resource as Responder. |
| Error format | Problem Details (RFC 9457) via `crell/api-problem`. Named exceptions (factory methods) implement `ProvidesProblemDetails::toProblemDetails()`, returning a `Responsable` `ProblemDetailsResponse`; the action catches the interface. Covers domain + validation errors. |
| Code style | Pint PER preset via committed `pint.json`. |
